Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: My predictions were correct

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After 1000, because less than 1000 can be in accurate and diffrence in chance of winning using more than 1000, was about 0.3%. Time of running though, was over three times higher.
