If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Their their audio is characterized by high energy, high danceabilit and moderate valence. It falls under pink category.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
This may not be very representative because very diffrent values can have the same average. I would take more values into account and if possible ask listern some questions to have even more detailed informations.
